# Grade-11-Pokemon-Game
A small pokemon game I made in grade 11 using the pygames library in python 2

Before you download the game please check the following:

1. Ensure that it is run with python 2, not python 3, when executing the py file.

2. Ensure the pygame library is installed on your device as the program will not function without it. The package can be normally installed. If you are on linux input the following command prompt: sudo apt-get install python-pygame

3. Ensure to change directories into the Pokemon folder and run the py file with python 2: Pokemon_Ryan_Version.py

4. Have fun and I hope you enjoy!
